## Me

My name is Anish Shah, a resident physician with an interest in programming, biostatistics, epidemiology, and cardiology. 

## Setup

The setup for this website included:

- Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
- Based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) with the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme
- Version control managed by Git and [Github](www.github.com)
- Hosted through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- Heavily developed using [Vim](www.vim.org), the text editor that works
