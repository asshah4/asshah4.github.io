# Thoughts 

Essentially a non-serialized blog, [thoughts](https://asshah4.github.io/thoughts) is a sandbox to document and explore ideas for me.

More important than a final product is the thought process and exploration required to get their. Poor documentation, either clinically or programmatically, leaves questions about the past. 

This started as a reflection on the start of specific functions, which ended up becoming parts of packages (e.g. `card`, `marksman`). It addressed clinical questions through research using `R`, and has slowly expanded to include clinical elements that provide context.

Key elements:

- technical and computational elements
- electrocardiography
- modeling and epidemiology
- autonomic dysfunction
- clinical cardiology

# [{card}](https://asshah4.github.io/card): Cardiovascular and Autonomic Research Design

As part of my research in computational neurocardiology, I've come to  respect the adage _Don't Repeat Yourself_. I've started to develop functions related to:

- cardiovascular disease
- signal processing
- epidemiology
- circadian rhythms
- recurrent event analysis

The package `{card}` was created to improve the research efforts in analyzing circadian and autonomic events, and is now available for download on CRAN.

# [{marksman}](https://asshah4.github.io/marksman): Marksman

As a researcher, both for grants and papers that are usually mechanistic / causal in nature, I've realized that the modeling workflow in R is very exploratory in nature, as seen in `tidymodels`. With my own research, a negative hypothesis should still be documented, and thus, holding on to and organizing hypotheses is important. 

__Marksman__ serves this purpose by creating a structured _specific aims_ object, with subsequent aims that hold specific, question-oriented hypotheses. By creating the aims up front, which is expected, it gives parallel pipelines in a project structure.

As of now, its still under development.
