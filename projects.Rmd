# Programming

As part of my research progress in computational neurocardiology, I've come to  respect the adage _Don't Repeat Yourself_. I've started to develop functions related to:

- cardiovascular disease
- signal processing
- epidemiology
- circadian rhythms

The package `{card}` was created to improve the research workflow. Take a look at [__card__](https://asshah4.github.io/card). 

# Documenting

I find that as I go along, poor documentation of ideas (whether it be code or clinical notes) leaves me questioning the past. I've started to document my [thoughts](https://asshah4.github.io/thoughts) as the `{card}` package is developed.
