# [{card}](https://asshah4.github.io/card): Cardiovascular and Autonomic Research Design

As part of my research in computational neurocardiology, I've come to  respect the adage _Don't Repeat Yourself_. I've started to develop functions related to:

- cardiovascular disease
- signal processing
- epidemiology
- circadian rhythms
- recurrent event analysis

The package `{card}` was created to improve the research workflow. 

# Thoughts [thoughts](https://asshah4.github.io/thoughts)

More important than a final product is the thought process and exploration required to get their. Poor documentation, either clinically or programmatically, leaves questions about the past. 

This started as a reflection on how the `{card}` package below was built, as it addressed clinical questions through research using `R`, and has slowly expanded to include clinical elements that provide context.

Key elements:

- technical and computational elements
- electrocardiography
- modeling and epidemiology
- autonomic dysfunction
- clinical cardiology
