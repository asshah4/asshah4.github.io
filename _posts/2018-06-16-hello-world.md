title: Hello World!

This is the first entry in a partially functioning site. Its based off of a combination of my own Jekyll local builds and Github generated pages. The first blog has been created at [Ultrasound reckoning](https://asshah4.github.io/ultrasound).

This site will be the user page for other projects, both research/code oriented and clinical reviews and documentation. The following is a rough structure to be expected.

Site | Description
--- | ---
Base camp | user-focused page as an umbrella site
Ultrasound reckoning | a blog on ultrasound as the physical exam
Black pearls | lessons in clinical medicine
Code blue | snippets of useful code with an amateur biostatistics bent

The actually Github repositories that are focused on research will have limited documentation due to confidentiality, but aspects that haven been helpful will be given their separate pages/posts.
