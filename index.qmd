# Howdy

My interest is in studying the effects of stress on the body. I do this using a computational approach to neurocardiology. I currently serve as a cardiology fellow at University of Illinois at Chicago on the research track, and work at both University of Illinois Hospital and the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

I am an active R user and have an interest in biostatistical techniques to analyze physiological data, such as circadian rhythms, using electrocardiography.
