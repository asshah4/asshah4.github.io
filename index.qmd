# I

Howdy!

I am a physician and scientist, in continual training for both.

I'm initially received my [baccalaureate](http://linguistics.emory.edu/home/) in linguistics and behavioral neuroscience from Emory University.

I returned to Texas to receive my doctorate from [Texas A&M University](https://medicine.tamu.edu).

I completed my initial clinical training as a resident physician of the [J. Willis Hurst Internal Medicine Residency](https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/education/residency-program/index.html) program at Emory University. 
I subsequently completed by initial research training at Emory in the Rollins School of Public Health, receiving a NIH-TL1 award and completing my [master's degree](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/education/masters.html).

I then moved to Chicago to for further clinical training as a cardiology fellow at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/departments/academic-departments/medicine/cardiology/education/fellowship-program/) and the [Jesse Brown VA](https://www.va.gov/chicago-health-care/locations/jesse-brown-department-of-veterans-affairs-medical-center/).
I was awarded and an NIH-F32 award and completed it on the research track as part of the institutional T32 program.

I am now moving to the [University of Utah](https://medicine.utah.edu/internal-medicine/cardiovascular-medicine) to (hopefully) complete my training in cardiac electrophysiology.
