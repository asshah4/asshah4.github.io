# I

Howdy!

I am a physician and scientist, in perpetual training for both.

I'm initially received my [baccalaureate](http://linguistics.emory.edu/home/) in linguistics and behavioral neuroscience from Emory University.

I returned to Texas to receive my doctorate from [Texas A&M University](https://medicine.tamu.edu).

I completed my initial clinical training as a resident physician of the [J. Willis Hurst Internal Medicine Residency](https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/education/residency-program/index.html) program at Emory University. 
I subsequently completed by initial research training at Emory in the Rollins School of Public Health, receiving a NIH-TL1 award and completing my [master's degree](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/education/masters.html).

I then moved to Chicago to for further clinical training as a cardiology fellow at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/departments/academic-departments/medicine/cardiology/education/fellowship-program/) and the [Jesse Brown VA](https://www.va.gov/chicago-health-care/locations/jesse-brown-department-of-veterans-affairs-medical-center/).
I completed an NIH-F32 award during the research track of our institutional T32 program in personalized cardiovascular medicine.

I am now moving to the [University of Utah](https://medicine.utah.edu/internal-medicine/cardiovascular-medicine) to complete my training in cardiac electrophysiology.

I am a husband to a beautiful and kind and wonderful wife, who has supported me every step of the way.

Together, we are the dog-parents to our super-smart and super-sassy dogs, Harper and Ripley.

I research stress and arrhythmias, and approach these topics through the lens of computational neurocardiology. 
As an avid programmer, I enjoy the methodology behind these research arms:

1. Epidemiology and causality, heavily influenced by biostatistical approaches
1. Signal processing of surface electrocardiograms and intracardiac electrograms, utilizing both heuristic and machine learning techniques
1. Genetic and epigenetic modifiers of arrhythmias
