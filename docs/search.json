    "text": "My interest is in studying the effects of stress on the body. I do this using a computational approach to neurocardiology. I currently serve as a cardiology fellow at University of Illinois at Chicago on the research track, and work at both University of Illinois Hospital and the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\nI am an active R user and have an interest in biostatistical techniques to analyze physiological data, such as circadian rhythms, using electrocardiography."

    "text": "February 01, 2021 A journal club on GALACTIC-HF, which was the one of the first looks at an oral inotropic agent that did not increase cardiovascular mortality (as compared with milrinone and dobutamine infusions).\nDecember 20, 2020 As a cardiology fellow, we have clinical case conferences to review interesting or puzzling cases with evidence-based analysis. Here is an interesting case of restrictive cardiomyopathy, including the work-up and a brief differential on etiologies.\nFebruary 18, 2019 As a medical resident, we complete a senior grand rounds, a summative talk of an area of our choosing. I researched psychological triggers for sudden cardiac death, and gave a “chalk talk” style presentation. There was an associated handout and notes with references. The concept of psychological triggers as affecting the ventricular substrate is fascinating, particularly as we learn more of the role of the autonomic nervous system in cardiovascular disease.\nMarch 21, 2018 With literature from early-terminated trials during 2018, I gave a journal club lecture on the updated guidelines on thrombectomy for ischemic strokes. My notes for it serve as a reference and series of citations, with a handout to improve viewer interaction. The largest issue I find was in the interpretation of their Table 1 showing non-adjusted odds ratios for an ordinal scale, listed next to a P-value.\nMarch 15, 2018 As a resident, there is a shift into becoming a teacher to both medical students and near-peers while being a learner as well. A significant amount of residents actually develop critical failures in the learning process. Here is an approach I presented, with supporting literature and an outline to be shared."
