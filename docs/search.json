    "text": "Howdy!\nI am a physician and scientist, in continual training for both.\nI’m initially received my baccalaureate in linguistics and behavioral neuroscience from Emory University.\nI returned to Texas to receive my doctorate from Texas A&M University.\nI completed my initial clinical training as a resident physician of the J. Willis Hurst Internal Medicine Residency program at Emory University. I subsequently completed by initial research training at Emory in the Rollins School of Public Health, receiving a NIH-TL1 award and completing my master’s degree.\nI then moved to Chicago to for further clinical training as a cardiology fellow at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Jesse Brown VA. I was awarded and an NIH-F32 award and completed it on the research track as part of the institutional T32 program.\nI am now moving to the University of Utah to (hopefully) complete my training in cardiac electrophysiology."

    "text": "THis is a series of formal presentations I’ve given that are primary academic, ranging on general medicine topics, medical education, and more recently in cardiology.\n\n\n\nFebruary 13, 2022 As a research fellow, I delivered a seminar on the progression of my research focus as it evolves into my K23 application. The seminar Vagolysis and Arrhythmogenesis summarises my views on how research-quality measures of autonomic dysfunction lead to cardiovascular mortality, and potential underlying mechanisms.\nFebruary 18, 2019 As a medical resident, we complete a senior grand rounds, a summative talk of an area of our choosing. I researched psychological triggers for sudden cardiac death, and gave a “chalk talk” style presentation. There was an associated handout and notes with references. The concept of psychological triggers as affecting the ventricular substrate is fascinating, particularly as we learn more of the role of the autonomic nervous system in cardiovascular disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 07, 2022 For the general cardiology fellows, I gave a lecture on typical AVNRT focused as an introduction for general fellows on how to diagnosis, management, and the intracardiac findings during electrophysiology studies.\nFebruary 01, 2021 A journal club on GALACTIC-HF, which was the one of the first looks at an oral inotropic agent that did not increase cardiovascular mortality (as compared with milrinone and dobutamine infusions).\nDecember 20, 2020 As a cardiology fellow, we have clinical case conferences to review interesting or puzzling cases with evidence-based analysis. Here is an interesting case of restrictive cardiomyopathy, including the work-up and a brief differential on etiologies.\nMarch 21, 2018 With literature from early-terminated trials during 2018, I gave a journal club lecture on the updated guidelines on thrombectomy for ischemic strokes. My notes for it serve as a reference and series of citations, with a handout to improve viewer interaction. The largest issue I find was in the interpretation of their Table 1 showing non-adjusted odds ratios for an ordinal scale, listed next to a P-value.\nMarch 15, 2018 As a resident, there is a shift into becoming a teacher to both medical students and near-peers while being a learner as well. A significant amount of residents actually develop critical failures in the learning process. Here is an approach I presented, with supporting literature and an outline to be shared.\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 23, 2023 An overview of echo-focused evaluation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nNovember 16, 2021 An introduction to antiplatelet agents in atherosclerotic disease.\nSeptember 26, 2018 Another bite-sized teaching mode talk on transfusions in sickle cell. Gave this talk again on October 4, 2018 at the Southern Hospital Medicine conference as an example of alternative teaching methods.\nFebruary 28, 2018 I gave a bite-sized teaching mode talk on treating rashes. The purpose of this style of talk is to explain and actually teach a topic in less than 8 minutes. Giving the talk itself emphasized learning how to teach."
